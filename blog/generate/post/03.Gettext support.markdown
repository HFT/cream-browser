*Cream-Browser* has now the ***gettext*** support and is now translatable.

I already made a french translation available on git. And a howto will be soon
available on the wiki.

***Q: Why now ? There is no more important things to do, like a GUI ?***

**A:** In fact, *gettext* support wasn't long to do. It was preferable to do
this now, before more translations to do (so a bigger work).

I hope that other translations will be available very soon :)
