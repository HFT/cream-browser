I'm glad to announce this to you.

After removing the **GTK+-2.0** support, I was able to use some features of **GTK+-3.0** which are not available on
**GTK+-2.0**. Features such as **CSS theming**.

Instead of loading a *GtkRc* file, **GTK+-3.0** loads a *CSS* file.

In my opinion, *GtkRc* is a big shit. If I wanted to keep **GTK+-2.0**, I had to use the *GtkWidget* tuning functions.
In other words : a painful trip. Another good reason to remove **GTK+-2.0** support.

If you don't want to use the default *GTK* theme, just put your custom *CSS* file into **~/.config/cream-browser/theme.css**

An example of *CSS* theme is already available on the *git* repository.

Have fun!
