Hi,

*Cream-Browser* is now able to be compiled with **DirectFB** support.

The only inconvenient is that **GTK+-3.0** drop the *DirectFB* support,
so you have to build Cream-Browser with **GTK+-2.0** (hopefully, both
versions are supported).

Do you want to know more ? Just go [here](https://github.com/linkdd/cream-browser/wiki/Directfb-support)
