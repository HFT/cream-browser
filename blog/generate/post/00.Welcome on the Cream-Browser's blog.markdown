Hi everybody.

I'm glad to tell you that the *Cream-Browser*'s blog is now open and powered by
[plstblog](https://github.com/linkdd/plstblog).

***Q: Why did I open this blog ?***

***A: In order to :***

* Announce every new release of Cream-Browser.
* Say welcome to every (eventual) new developers.
* Do what a blog does.

Of course, it will be less active than the mailing lists (I hope so !).

And if you want constant informations, you may have to subscribe to those
mailing lists :

* [Developers mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/cream-browser-devel)
* [Users mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/cream-browser-users)
