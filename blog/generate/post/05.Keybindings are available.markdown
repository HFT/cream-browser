Hi every body !

I'm happy to tell you that **key bindings** are now available in *cream-browser* !

    17:00 <CIA-69> cream-browser: David Delassus unstable * r0feb308 / (21 files in 3 dirs): Add keybindings (soon a note on the blog) - http://git.io/In8GfA

The lua bindings are already available :

    cream.keys.map (statelist, modkeys_list, command, callback)

**statelist** is a list of state where your keybind will be affected, here is the different states of *cream-browser* :

    cream.state.insert   # You are typing in a webview
    cream.state.command  # You are typing a command in the inputbox
    cream.state.search   # You are typing a search command in the inputbox
    cream.state.embed    # A plugin (ie. flashplayer) own the focus (not yet implemented)
    cream.state.caret    # CARET browsing (not yet implemented)
    cream.state.normal   # Normal state
    cream.state.all      # All states

Here is an example :

     cream.keys.map ({ cream.state.all }, { }, "Escape",
               function (w)
                    cream.inputbox.text ("")
                    cream.state.current (cream.state.normal)
               end)

     cream.keys.map ({ { cream.state.normal, cream.state.embed, cream.state.caret }, { "Shift" }, "colon",
               function (w)
                    cream.inputbox.text (":")
                    cream.inputbox.focus ()
               end)

     -- Paste command \o/
     cream.keys.map ({ cream.state.normal, cream.state.embed, cream.state.caret }, { }, "pp",
               function (w)
                    uri = cream.clipboard.primary:get ()

                    if uri ~= "" then
                         w:open (uri)
                    end
               end)

**NB: You HAVE TO precise all modkeys (ie. "Shift" + P)**

**NB: You have to write the full name of the key (ie. minus an not -)**

Enjoy! :)
