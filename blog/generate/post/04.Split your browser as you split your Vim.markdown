Oe of the *Cream-Browser*'s killer feature is the **GtkVimSplit** which allow you to split your browser in multiple views, just like ***vim*** :)

This feature is now finished, and to end the GUI I just have to finish the *inputbox*, the *statusbar* and the *theme engine*.

Soon a GUI for *Cream-Browser* !
