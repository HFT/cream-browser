Cream is a light web browser developped in C using the layout engine WebKit and
the graphical library GTK+. The interface looks like Vimperator, a Firefox addon
to use Firefox like the famous text editor : Vim.

To build Cream-Browser :
     $ mkdir __build__
     $ cd __build__
     $ ../configure
     $ make
     $ sudo make install

To build the documentation :
     $ cd doc
     $ make
